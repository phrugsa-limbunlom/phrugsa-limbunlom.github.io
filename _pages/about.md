<p style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify; margin: 0;">
    I am passionate to apply my skills in QA, software development, and AI to design high-quality, efficient human-level intelligence systems. Before starting my master’s program, I worked as a backend developer building robust and scalable software through microservices and API integration. I also gained experience as a quality analyst conducting both manual and automated testing to maintain rigorous software quality standards. My career has included roles at global IT consulting firms, where I contributed to Agile projects and collaborated with cross-functional teams. With a solid foundation in both software development and quality assurance, I am now eager to deepen my expertise in AI. After completing my master’s degree, I plan to pursue a PhD in Cognitive AI and AI reasoning.

Research Interest
-------------------------------------
<p style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify; margin: 0;">
    My research focuses on enhancing cognitive function in the current machine intelligence system. I am interested in researching approaches to tackle reasoning challenges in current LLM and multimodel, especially vision-related tasks. I am currently studying the feasibility of leveraging Joint-embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) and energy-based models to address such problems. I aim to build a logical human-level intelligence system that requires a small sample when learning new situations.

    SE-GAN: Sentiment-Enhanced GAN for Stock Price Forecasting
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center">
    Abstract
</div>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify; margin: 0;">
    Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the inherent volatility of the market and the complexity of price movement. Traditional models still encounter limitations when faced with restricted historical data, which leads to over-fitting problems and poor performance on unseen data. Furthermore, market sentiment is a crucial factor for price fluctuations, yet several models still fail to adequately capture this important factor. To address the issues, the research proposes a novel deep learning network architecture. The approach leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) to expand the training set and generalize on unseen data by generating synthetic historical data. As the GAN model generates prediction of closing prices, the generated prices can be compared with actual market movements to assess its performance. To capture the impact of market sentiment, the model also integrates sentiment analysis from financial news. This integration allows a more comprehensive technique for price forecasting, considering both quantitative historical data and qualitative sentiment indicators. The model was trained on historical data of Microsoft stock (MSFT) from January 2013 to December 2023. To conduct market sentiment analysis on financial news, FINBERT will be utilized to extract sentiment scores from headlines. Additionally, various index of Microsoft stock (MSFT) are integrated in the training data. The proposed model, Sentiment-Enhanced GAN (SE-GAN), integrates sentiment analysis with generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate more robust and accurate stock price predictions. The SE-GAN model demonstrates the lowest Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) for overall experiment setting compared to baselines models including Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), as well as TimeGPT as another generative model. The improvement suggests that the SE-GAN approach offers a more effective method for predicting stock prices, leveraging the combined strengths of sentiment analysis and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

    MANDY: Empirical Investigation And Supporting Program For Mandibular Fracture Classification And Localization Algorithms On X-ray Images Of Skulls
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center">
    Abstract
</div>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify; margin: 0;">
    Accidents, especially traffic accidents, are a common occurrence in Thailand, and there are many who encounter fractures to their skull or face. The mandible is a prominent bone in the face that is relatively easy to break, and although treatment can be effective, doctors need to know the fracture location (or locations) immediately to reduce the risk of other injuries. Diagnoses of the fractures is done by X-Ray, and X- Ray films are used as they are low-cost. However, locating fractures in the mandible using X-Ray film can be difficult and often requires the opinion of a specialist. As such, a computer-aided diagnostic tool would lead to faster, more accurate, and less costly analysis. To our knowledge, no research has been undertaken on the effectiveness of such technology in mandibular fracture detection from X-Ray images. Therefore, this project will investigate relevant models and techniques, and deploy algorithms on real X-Rays, which will help non-specialist doctors diagnose mandibular fractures quickly, accurately, and without reference to a specialist. Moreover, the project will support medical research and study the efficiency and effectiveness of web applications in clinical practice.
